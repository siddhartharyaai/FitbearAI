## Current Status: M0 In Progress - 65% Complete

### Implemented Features (Working):

### Critical Missing Integrations (35% Gap):

- [ ] **Settings Page**: Completely missing
- [ ] **PostHog Analytics**: Created but NOT initialized or tracking
- [ ] **PWA Registration**: Files created but NOT registered in layout
- [ ] **OCR Fallback UI**: No degraded confidence banners visible

### Backend vs Frontend Status:
- **Backend**: ~85% complete (APIs working, components created)
- **Frontend**: ~45% complete (core features work, integrations missing)

### Current Focus: Complete Missing Frontend Integrations
Need to implement voice integration, full onboarding, settings page, analytics tracking, and PWA registration to achieve true M0 completion.

### Technical Debt:
- Documentation claimed M0 complete prematurely
- README test commands incorrect (node vs python)
- Analytics env var naming inconsistent
- Service worker created but not registered

### Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. **Fix documentation honesty**
2. **Integrate voice features in Coach Chat**
3. **Implement full BPS onboarding form**
4. **Create Settings page with export/delete**
5. **Initialize PostHog analytics and event tracking**
6. **Register PWA service worker**
7. **Add OCR fallback UI banners**
8. **Run acceptance tests**
9. **Update docs with real completion status**

**Honest Status**: ðŸš§ **M0 IN PROGRESS - NOT YET COMPLETE** ðŸš§
